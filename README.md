# InputValidation
Simple form input validation. To be used when you need a quick on the fly no nonsense validation.

This simple class is not meant to replace some of he more advanced validation scripts, its simply a substitute for
when you have pre existing forms that are not part of any form solution and just need to validate
simply and quickly.
